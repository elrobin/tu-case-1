## Negative effects of a pervasive scientific reward system
 
1. Research quality: Low quality, overproduction, lack of replication, research integrity, fraud, hypercompetition (less collaboration),
2. Societal challenges: Not aligned with societal needs but with greater impact within scientific community.
3. Teaching. Something on students and teaching? For instance, the predatory publishing is a nice add-on
4. Transparency. P-hacking, reproducibility, under-reporting of negative results
5. Poor selection process. Incentivizing malpractices would lead to the 'wrong' type of future scientists needed to ensure scientific progress.
6. Long-term agendas. Publish or perish culture is short-sighted.

## Reasons why bibliometrics are blamed

1. Bibliometricians are also scientists and their behavior has been modified (A nice example could be the H-index bubble.)
2. Indicators as technologies of distance
3. Disruptive changes in scholarly communication
4. Goodhart's Law

## (E)valuation models 

Here I've got much literature to show and discuss. This should end with some comments on common components of all models and proposals.

Key conclusions to include:

- The problem are not with the metrics but with the abuse and misuse of metrics. 
- Criteria can be generazible but indicators should be contextual. E.g., narratives or qualitative approaches may not be always feasible.
- Valuation models should be operationalized in a manageable number of ways, criteria should not always be as explicit as indicating the indicators used -> Goodhart's Law.
- Weights depend on the why of the evaluation scheme. Productivity might be desirable in some contexts but not in others.

## Multidimensional valuation model 

1. Evaluative dimensions:
  - Trajectory
  - Capacity building
  - Scientific engagement
  - Social engagement
  - Open practices

2. Confounding effects
  - Cultural practices
  - Institutional logics

3. Personal features. Description of policy relevant issues with some examples: gender, age, country of origin.
